Icons are from:

  http://www.defaulticon.com/

See "defaulticon.zip".

Some icons were in canvases larger than 16x16 and all have been
changed to that size.

Note that the "find" icon is actually one of mine. The "table" icon
is custom drawn using a copy of one of the defaulticon.com icons as
a base. The "add" icon had anti-aliasing pixels removed to improve
its clarity.
