# Canvass v1.0.1 2013-10-24

Canvass lets you define polls which are 'voted' on by users who make
financial donations to a cause.

This is a customised version for RISC OS Open, copied from the master
SVN repository. At the time of writing it isn't generally useful (certain
shared ROOL view components are missing).


## Changes

* v1.0.1: Add administrator ability to revert an underway bounty to an
          open state.

* v1.0.0: Initial release.
