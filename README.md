# Canvass v1.0.2 2014-05-03

Canvass lets you define polls which are 'voted' on by users who make
financial donations to a cause.

This copy relies on a shared sign-on system called Hub which is not
generally available in GitHub nor all that easy to set up. You can
find it on http://pond.org.uk/ and, if you can get it going, then
it should set up login cookies that Canvass then uses.

RISC OS Open run a customised version of Canvass under their bounty
scheme at http://www.riscosopen.org/ - their Subversion repository
contains the code.


## Changes

* v1.0.2: Allow adminstrators to register external donations (e.g. made by
          cheque) rather than only supporting through-Canvass payments.

* v1.0.1: Add administrator ability to revert an underway bounty to an
          open state.

* v1.0.0: Initial release.
