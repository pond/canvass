# Canvass v1.0.0 2011-03-21

Canvass lets you define polls which are 'voted' on by users who make
financial donations to a cause.

This is a customised version for RISC OS Open, copied from the master
SVN repository. At the time of writing it isn't generally useful (certain
shared ROOL view components are missing).
