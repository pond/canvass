# Canvass v1.0.2 2014-05-03

Canvass lets you define polls which are 'voted' on by users who make
financial donations to a cause.

This is a customised version for RISC OS Open, copied from the master
SVN repository. At the time of writing it isn't generally useful (certain
shared ROOL view components are missing).


## Changes

* v1.0.2: Allow adminstrators to register external donations (e.g. made by
          cheque) rather than only supporting through-Canvass payments.

* v1.0.1: Add administrator ability to revert an underway bounty to an
          open state.

* v1.0.0: Initial release.
